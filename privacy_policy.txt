Privacy Policy

Effective date: October 20, 2025

Developer: Keekys

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Gaze application (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles user data. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

2. Data Collection and Use

The App does not collect, store, or share any personal information.

The only permission required is Usage Access, which is used solely to read your screen time data locally on your device — such as how long each app has been used.

This information is not uploaded to any server, not shared with third parties, and not stored outside your device.

3. Data Storage and Sharing

All data remains on your device and is processed locally. No data is transmitted over the internet or stored remotely.

4. Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

5. Changes to This Policy

If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, the updated version will be available within the app and/or on the store listing.
